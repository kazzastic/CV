# Image Processing Practices 
All the Image Processing courses I have done and their short codes are just here as some sort of "anecdotes" I guess.
some really amazing works here include 

- Maze solved on an image with BFS [here](https://github.com/kazzastic/CV/tree/master/maze)

- Face recognition without machine learing [here](https://github.com/kazzastic/CV/blob/master/face_rec.py)

- Specific human face recognition with machine learning [here](https://github.com/kazzastic/CV/blob/master/machine_learing.py)

- Really cool OCR detection simple intro code [here](https://github.com/kazzastic/CV/blob/master/OCR.py)

and yea just 
```python
pip install opencv-python
pip install face_recognition 
pip install PIL 
pip install get_a_life_jk
```
:D
