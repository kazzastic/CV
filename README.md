# maze_solving_image_processing
Libraries used matplot, numpy, openCV, mazelib
The basic idea here is to solve the given maze using the shortest-path algorithm.
the library mazelib has been used so far to solve complex mazes.

The second step is supposed to be image processing, where the given image would be converted 
into the numbers(1's and 0's) which the library mazelib can process and solve on its own.

The third step is to integrate the above given processing of image processing and maze solving in 
real life maze solving car build upon raspberry pi using python and RPI GPIO library.
