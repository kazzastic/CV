    The Algorithm

    1. Start with a complete, valid maze.
    2. Add a small number of random walls, blocking current passages.
    3. Go through the maze and reconnect all passages that are not currently open,
        by randomly opening walls.
    4. Repeat steps 3 and 4 a prescribed number of times.

    Optional Parameters

    new_walls: Integer [1, ...)
        The number of randomly positioned new walls you create throughout the maze. (default 1)
    repeat: Integer [1, ...)
        The number of times sets of new walls will be added to the maze;
        the maze being fixed after each set. (default 1)
